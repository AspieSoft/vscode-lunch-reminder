# Lunch Reminder

Don't forget to eat lunch

For developers who enjoy programing, and sometimes forget to stop and eat lunch, this extension is here to help.

At your chosen lunch time in settings, this extension will pop up a reminder that interrupts your typing and requires you to type OK to dismiss the reminder. The extension will also keep track of the last time you typed to recognize if you are idle. You will get repeated reminders every once in a while until it detects you have stopped typing for a period of time. The extension also will pick up where it left off if you restart vscode. After a number of repetitive reminders, and after a specific time, you can choose when the extension goes into strict mode. Strict mode will try to lock you out of using vscode for a temporary amount of time to help force you to stop and eat lunch.

Since this is in beta, if your worded about something going wrong you can configure a setting "Lunch Reminder: Force Stop Command" and set it to a text you can type any time to force the reminder to stop.
